            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a Senior in the Tippie College of Business, I am pursuing a dual major in Entrepreneurial Management and Business Analytics and Information Systems. My keen interest in the inner workings of businesses has guided me towards these complementary fields of study. While Entrepreneurial Management offers insights into effective business management strategies, Business Analytics and Information Systems empowers me with the capability to optimize profit and productivity through data analysis and technology.
                As graduation approaches, I am actively searching for full-time employment opportunities to begin my career.</p>
